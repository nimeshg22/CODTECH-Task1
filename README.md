Delete Records:

Provides options to delete individual book records or the entire inventory, ensuring flexibility and control over data management.
Change Book Availability:

Allows librarians to change the status of a book from available to issued and vice versa based on transactions.
User-Friendly Interface:

Utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, providing ease of use and intuitive navigation for library staff.
Data Persistence:

Utilizes SQLite for backend database management, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying of library records.
Error Handling:

Includes robust error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions like duplicate book IDs and missing data inputs.
Clear and Display Functionality:

Provides clear fields and display functions to reset input fields and refresh the library inventory view after operations.
